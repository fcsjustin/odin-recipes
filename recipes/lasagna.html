        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Making lasagna is a rewarding process that starts with preparing a rich meat sauce, where ground beef or sausage is simmered with onions, garlic, and a blend of tomatoes and herbs until deeply flavorful. While the sauce cooks, you can also make a creamy ricotta mixture by blending it with egg, Parmesan cheese, and a bit of parsley, adding layers of texture and taste.</p>
        <p>Assembling the lasagna involves layering sheets of pasta with the meat sauce, ricotta mixture, and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella cheese. The layers are repeated until the dish is full, then baked until bubbly and golden. The result is a hearty, comforting meal with gooey cheese and savory sauce, perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying as leftovers.</p>
